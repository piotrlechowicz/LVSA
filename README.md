Stress detector based on the throut micro tremors.

Stress can be observed by changes in the voice frequency.
Unstressed voice contains base frequency between 8 to 12 Hz, and stressed voice base frequency doesn't fit into this range. Component frequencies of voice are obtained with empirical mode decomposition.
